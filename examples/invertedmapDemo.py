# First, create a random data matrix
N = 5000
D = 20

X = numpy.random.randn(N,D)


# Apply a random projection so the data's not totally boring
P = numpy.random.randn(D, D)

X = numpy.dot(X, P)

# Construct a tree.  This time, we'll use a random projection tree of height 10

print('Building tree...')
T = spatialtree(X, rule='rp', height=10)
print('done.')

# Show some useful information about the tree
print('# items in tree    : ', len(T))
print('Dimensionality     : ', T.getDimension())
print('Height of tree     : ', T.getHeight())
print('Spill percentage   : ', T.getSpill())
print('Split rule         : ', T.getRule())

#
# By default, spatialtree retains index information at every level 
# throughout the tree.  This facilitates pruning and other dynamic 
# modifications to the tree.  However, if your data set and tree
# are static (after construction of the tree), then we can make a more
# space-efficient data structure by using an inverted map.
#
# The invertedmap structure only stores the relationship between items
# and the leaves of the tree from which it is constructed.

print('Converting tree T to inverted map I...')
I = invertedmap(T)
print('done.')

# Some stats:
print('# items in the map : ', len(I))
print('# leaf sets        : ', I.numSets())

# It can answer k_nearest queries just like a spatialtree
knn_t = T.k_nearest(X, k=10, index=499)
print('KNN approx (tree)  : ', knn_t)

# The imap discards all vector data from the structure,
# so it can only answer queries by index.
knn_i = I.k_nearest(X, k=10, index=499)
print('KNN approx (imap)  : ', knn_i)

# You can also delete items from the inverted map, but
# new nodes cannot be added.

I.remove(499)
